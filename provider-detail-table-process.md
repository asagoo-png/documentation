# Provider Detail Table Building Process

This document outlines the process of building the provider detail table, including a pictorial diagram that visualizes the five essential steps involved.

## Process Overview

1. **Analyzing Providers In-Scope**  
   Understand the requirements and identify the providers that need to be included in the table.

2. **Gathering Data**  
   Collect the necessary data for each provider, which may include basic information, NPI numbers, and other relevant identifiers.

3. **Mapping NPI to Source IDs**  
   For each provider, ensure that the NPI numbers are accurately mapped to their corresponding source IDs. This ensures data integrity and usability.

4. **Data Validation**  
   Perform checks to validate the accuracy of the data gathered, identifying any discrepancies or missing information.

5. **Completing the Client-Specific Table**  
   Finalize the table for client use, with all columns filled with the necessary information, ensuring that NPI mappings and source IDs are populated correctly.
